In the beginning of chapther three in the book Clean Code, A Handbook of Agile Software Craftmanship, there is a statement regarding function length. And it states that functions should be just 3 - 4 lines long! I truly think that is kind off impossible and more of a utopian view. 


I have in general adapted a "one function, one task" mindset when writing my functions. Which according to the book is a very positive behaviour. And I do agree, to some degree. I do find the use of the bigger functions that are not heavily built on functionallity but more delegate tasks to other functions. 

The idea that the book presents that try/catch methods are ugly and confusing I do not share. Especially when working with http calls I want to be sure that my code runs in the order that im telling it too. And then try/catch methods are of use in a function. However I do realize when it comes to readability this is not the preferred way. If I think about it, If I would be presented with a codebase I would way rather have the try/catch method broken out into its own function. 

D.R.Y.... I think there is no other concept that have been more beaten into us at this point. And honestly, I do still repeat myself from time to time. When looking back at my code from previous projects I do realize that the functions I write are very specific. They handle one specific case with one or more specific variables. Therefore it is difficult to reuse them. That is a practice I do need to get better at.
